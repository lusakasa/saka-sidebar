# saka-sidebar
A vertical toolbar extension for Chrome for maximizing screen real estate

## Basic Idea

A small toolbar positioned on the right or left side of the screen.

It is implemented as a small iframe (for security) loaded into the top frame of every page.

By default, only back, forward, refresh, the URL bar, and the favicon of all open tabs are displayed.

On hover, full labels are shown.

Favicons are shown in either historical or positional order of tabs.

Sidebar should be resizable, themable.

Eventually integrate with Saka for hotkeys.
